Imagine spending New Year's Eve making this website, Wooo.

<sub>*Dec-21-2022*</sub>

Finished Trial-#4 in milestone folder, that one is current milestone, need to practice environment drawing and more consistent colours, "make it glow", "strike some feeling". Need to add a gallery in the future maybe?

Hello, this is my first attempt using Markdown. 
Since I can't think of some contents right now,
let this page be a collection of things I find interesting.

# --My Site--
Supposed to be a site that holds everything me-related

### ---Remember--- 
You, yes you, used webkit for fancy card in recipes, if something goes wrong, remove that!


### To Do 
- [ ] Dynamic routing?
- [ ] Write something in the about me section
- [ ] App for adding recipes, never, removing recipes

### Super super future functionalities
- [ ] Gallery: Add in a place for my drawings? (wait until when I can actually draw)
- [ ] Add in a function for email recipes

# --Jim's Task App -- 
This is gonna be very helpful in getting my tasks on a server, and using the mobile app to add/delete quickly
- [ ] Buy a cheap android phone and curse apple
- [ ] Maybe talk to my recipe api on this app too
