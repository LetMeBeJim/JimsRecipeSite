# --My Site--
Supposed to be a site that holds everything me-related

### To Do
- [ ] Layout Recipes Database
    - [x] do bootstrap maybe? 
- [ ] Optimize for mobile
    - [ ] definitely use bootstrap for all pages other than Home, that one is gone
- [ ] Add actual recipe data
    - [x] database structure done
- [x] Remember to add insta link in the recipe data entry, use the insta link to get image for banner display
- [ ] Sub pages? 
- [ ] Write something in the about me section

### Super super future functionalities
- [ ] Add in a search function for recipes
- [ ] Add in a place for my drawings? (wait until when I can actually draw)
- [ ] Add in a function for adding recipes
- [ ] Add in a function for email recipes
- [ ] Add page for everything I know about drawing? I should store what I know somewhere
    - [ ] I'm thinking maybe like, small nav-bar on the left that leads to sub pages? maybe?

# --Discord Mental Relief Bot--
So, imagine a bot that gives you a image from the weekly top list on Pixiv, that gotta make the day better eh?

### To Do
- [ ] Add delay for the bot reaction and fix the bot not uploading pictures issue
    - [x] Is picture downloading?
    - [ ] Is bot responding?
    - [ ] Is picture deleted after wards?
