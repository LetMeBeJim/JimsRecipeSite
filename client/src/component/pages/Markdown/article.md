Imagine spending New Year's Eve making this website, Wooo.

Finished Trial-#4 in milestone folder, that one is current milestone, need to practice environment drawing and more consistent colours, "make it glow", "strike some feeling". Need to add a gallery in the future maybe?

Hello, this is my first attempt using Markdown. 
Since I can't think of some contents right now,
let this page be a collection of things I find interesting.

# --My Site--
Supposed to be a site that holds everything me-related

### ---Remember--- 
You, yes you, used webkit for fancy card in recipes, if something goes wrong, remove that!


### To Do 
- [ ] Optimize for mobile
    -[x] Home page
    -[ ] individual recipes
    -[ ] markdown
- [x] Add actual recipe data that you like
    - [ ] you should add the yellow braised chicken one
- [ ] Either use query string to get recipes, or move the page formatting into a function
    - [ ] Let's not do query string, moving page return makes it easier to be manipulated
- [ ] Dynamic routing?
- [ ] RESTful API
    - [x] Server end organization
    - [ ] Client side get data follows /api/:id, instead of current filter
- [ ] Do a dynamic page about languages I know and where I learned them from, when cursor hover on language, make it so all other courses disappear and only where I learned that language remains
- [ ] Write something in the about me section

### Super super future functionalities
- [ ] Add in a search function for recipes
- [ ] Add in a place for my drawings? (wait until when I can actually draw)
- [ ] Add in a function for adding recipes
- [ ] Add in a function for email recipes
- [ ] Add page for everything I know about drawing? I should store what I know somewhere
    - [ ] I'm thinking maybe like, small nav-bar on the left that leads to sub pages? maybe?

# --Discord Mental Relief Bot--
So, imagine a bot that gives you a image from the weekly top list on Pixiv, that gotta make the day better eh?

### To Do
- [ ] Add delay for the bot reaction and fix the bot not uploading pictures issue
    - [x] Is picture downloading?
    - [ ] Is bot responding?
    - [ ] Is picture deleted after wards?
